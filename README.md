# Hey there. Nice to meet you! 👋

... and thank you for visiting my GitHub page! May I introduce myself? My name is **Daniel Kleebinder** and I am a _Software Engineer_ and _Architect_ who is very much excited to build the _Web_ of tomorrow using cutting edge technologies.

## About me 👨‍💻

My love for software engineering started while studying informatics at [HTL St. Pölten](https://www.htlstp.ac.at/). Afterwards, I completed my bachelor's degree at [FH Technikum Wien](https://www.technikum-wien.at/) in 2020 and am now a proud alumni of [TU Wien](https://www.tuwien.at/) where I completed my [master's studies in software engineering](https://informatics.tuwien.ac.at/master/software-engineering-and-internet-computing/) at the beginning of 2023.
